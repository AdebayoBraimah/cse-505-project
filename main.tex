    \section{Problem \& Plan}
    \label{sec:prob_plan}
    
    \subsection{Problem Description}
    \label{subsec:problem}
    Scheduling is a highly non-trivial problem that arises in throughout many fields and industrial applications. Several examples include the job-scheduling problem\cite{scheduling1972}, and the nurse scheduling problem\cite{nurse2017}.
    University course planning/scheduling and understanding of graduation requirements can be a difficult process for new, in-coming students at all levels of one's education\cite{lunch2023}. Generally, new students are guided through this process by way of an academic advisor. However, this approach is expensive in both time and personnel (which are usually university faculty) -- especially in the case in which the personnel have to be trained on where to find and understand these graduation requirements. Additionally, in some cases -- the advising can be further complicated by the student's own personal interests (e.g. research focus, specific areas of interests, etc). The proposed solution to this problem would be knowledge graphs that are queried for course schedule building. A summary of the inputs and outputs are shown below:

    \subsubsection{Input \& Output}
    \label{subsubsec:in-out}
    
    \textbf{Inputs}:

    \begin{itemize}
        \label{items:inputs}
        \item Major
        \item Degree level: bachelors (masters and doctorate are not implemented in this project)
        \item Current degree progress (e.g. classes already taken)
        \item Knowledge graphs
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Graduation requirements
            \item Department policies (e.g. restrictions on pass/fail courses)
            % Policy links:
            % https://www.cs.stonybrook.edu/sites/default/files/drupalfiles/basicpage/Undergraduate%20Policies.pdf
            % https://www.cs.stonybrook.edu/sites/default/files/drupalfiles/basicpage/Professional%20Ethics.pdf
        \end{itemize}
    \end{itemize}

    \textbf{Outputs}:

    \begin{itemize}
        \label{items:outputs}
        \item Recommended schedule(s)
        \item Course recommendations
    \end{itemize}

    % Requirements
    \subsubsection{Requirements}
    \label{subsubsec:reqs}
    The requirements for this project would include:

    \begin{itemize}
        \item Tools
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Python
            \begin{itemize}
                \item Selenium (for web scraping, and web browser interface)
                \item BeautifulSoup4 (for web scraping) 
                \item requests (for web scraping)
                \item Pandas\cite{pandas} (for organizing data)
            \end{itemize}
            \item Clingo (ASP\footnote{Answer Set Programming} solver)\cite{clingo}
            % \item ErgoAI (Knowledge graph (KG) querying)
            % \item LLMs (large language models, multiple are shown -- likely only one will be used)
            % \begin{itemize}
            %     \item LLaMA\cite{touvron2023llama}/LLaMA-2\cite{touvron2023llama2}
            %     \item Alpaca\cite{alpaca}
            %     \item Chat-GPT 3.5-turbo\cite{ye2023gpt3.5}
            % \end{itemize}
        \end{itemize}
        \item Performance evaluation
            \begin{itemize}
                \item Measure the time and accuracy of each query and compare it to Stony Brook University's schedule builder\cite{sched}
            \end{itemize}
        \item Comparison of solutions
            \begin{itemize}
                \item Compare the output of the course schedules and recommendations with Stony Brook University graduation requirements (for computer science majors).
            \end{itemize}
    \end{itemize}
    
    % example uses
    \subsubsection{Example use-cases}
    \label{subsubsec:example}
    Moreover, the use cases of these solutions from this project are widely applicable to Stony Brook University's undergraduate, and graduate student populations as a whole. For example, these groups of students would find significant utility from this project's solutions:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item An undergraduate computer science student looking to meet the graduation requirements for a combined BS/MS in 5 years.
        \item A MS graduate student in the computer science department looking to satisfy graduation requirements in 2 years, taking 9--12 credits per semester.
        \item A computer science PhD student looking to satisfy course and department policy requirements prior to candidacy.
    \end{itemize}

    Granted the above use-cases were for computer science students -- ideally, most of the Stony Brook University student population would derive some benefit from this project.

    \subsection{State of the art}
    \label{subsec:sota}
    Current state-of-the-art (SOTA) approaches for this problem at Stony Brook University includes the \href{https://you.stonybrook.edu/uaamedia/schedulebuilder/}{schedule builder} in addition to LUNCH\cite{lunch2023}. In the case of LUNCH, while it is a mostly automated approach -- it does require significant user input, and only provides the schedule for one semester. In the case of the schedule builder -- it will mostly help students build a schedule, semester by semester\cite{sched}, but it will not recommend classes.

    \subsection{Tasks \& Sub-tasks}
    \label{subsec:tasks}
    Currently, this project has no relation to any external projects (both through adjacent course work and for research purposes). Below are the corresponding tasks and sub-tasks for the project:

    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Task 1}: Knowledge graph construction (via web scraping)
        \begin{itemize}
            \item \textbf{Sub-task 1.1}: Create knowledge graphs of Stony Brook University undergraduate and graduate computer science graduation requirements (including department policies)
        \end{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Task 2}: Build API
        \begin{itemize}
            \item \textbf{Sub-task 2.1}: Create output knowledge base that can be queried.
        \end{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Task 3}: Test \& Evaluate

    \end{itemize}
    
    \section{Implementation}
    \label{sec:implement}

    \subsection{Design Implementation}
    \label{subsec:des-imp}

    The current design implementation has focused on translating knowledge graphs into facts. Correspondingly, knowledge bases were translated into rules. For example, the the class information shown in the JSON snippet below,  could be translated into the following fact:

    \begin{lstlisting}
    {
        .
        .
        .
        "CSE 214":{
        "Course Title":"Data Structures",
        "Career":"Undergraduate",
        "Credits":4.0,
        "Prerequisites":[
            [
                "CSE 114"
            ]
        ]
    },
    "CSE 215":{
        "Course Title":"Foundations of Computer Science",
        "Career":"Undergraduate",
        "Credits":4.0,
        "Prerequisites":[
            [
                "AMS 151",
                "MAT 125",
                "MAT 131"
            ]
        ]
    },
    .
    .
    .
    }
    \end{lstlisting}

    Facts translation in Clingo (located in: {\tt{src/resources/cse\_courses.lp}})): \\
    
    \begin{lstlisting}
        % Clingo code
        % Define course(course_name, credits, career, offered_spring, offered_fall)
        course(cse214, 4, "Undergraduate", 1, 1).
        course(cse215, 4, "Undergraduate", 1, 1).
        .
        .
        .
        % Define prerequisites
        .
        .
        .
        % Prerequisites for CSE214
        :- course(cse214, 4, "Undergraduate", 1, 1), 
           not course(cse114, _, "Undergraduate", _, _). 
        
        % Prerequisites for CSE215
        :- course(cse215, 4, "Undergraduate", 1, 1), 
           not course(ams151, _, "Undergraduate", _, _), 
           not course(mat125, _, "Undergraduate", _, _), 
           not course(mat131, _, "Undergraduate", _, _). 
    \end{lstlisting}

    Correspondingly, the knowledge base facts were translated into rules. For example, the fact a student needs take a minimum of 12 credits a semester (to maintain full time student status, shown on line 3 in the listing below as a constant), but a maximum of 18 credits (shown on line 4 as constant in the listing below) over $N$ semesters to graduate with CSE major 80 credits and 120 total credits would be translated as the following in Clingo (in the file, {\tt{results/cse\_bs\_grad\_reqs.lp}}): \\

    \begin{lstlisting}
        % Constants
        #const max_semesters = 12.
        #const min_credits_per_semester = 12.
        #const max_credits_per_semester = 18.
        
        % Define possible semesters
        semester(1..max_semesters).
        
        % Schedule courses across semesters
        1 { schedule(Course, Sem) : semester(Sem) } 1 :- course(Course, Credits, Career, Spring, Fall).
        
        % Prevent scheduling of courses already taken
        :- course_taken(Course), schedule(Course, _).
        
        % Semester limits: at least 12 credits and at most 18 credits per semester
        :- semester(Sem), SemCredits = #count { Credits, Course : schedule(Course, Sem), course(Course, Credits, "Undergraduate", _, _) }, SemCredits < min_credits_per_semester.
        :- semester(Sem), SemCredits = #count { Credits, Course : schedule(Course, Sem), course(Course, Credits, "Undergraduate", _, _) }, SemCredits > max_credits_per_semester.

        % Ensure all scheduled courses comply with seasonal offerings
        :- schedule(Course, Sem), course(Course, _, "Undergraduate", Spring, Fall), 
           Sem \ 2 = 1, Fall = 0.
        :- schedule(Course, Sem), course(Course, _, "Undergraduate", Spring, Fall), 
           Sem \ 2 = 0, Spring = 0.
        
        % Count total credits and major credits
        total_credits(Total) :- Total = #sum { Credits, Course : schedule(Course, _), course(Course, Credits, "Undergraduate", _, _) }.
        major_credits(Major) :- Major = #sum { Credits, Course : schedule(Course, _), course(Course, Credits, "Undergraduate", _, _) }.
        
        % Graduation requirements
        :- total_credits(Total), Total < 120.
        :- major_credits(Major), Major < 80.
        
        % Objective to minimize the number of semesters
        #minimize { 1, Sem : schedule(_, Sem) }.
        
        #show schedule/2.
    \end{lstlisting}

    Moreover, the above code suffers from combinatorial explosion (i.e. the number of combinations that satisfies the model are so large, that the optimal model would take a significant amount of time to be computed).
    Instead, computing the schedule of two semesters is far more feasible. The code to do so is located in the file {\tt{results/sem.lp}}): \\

    \begin{lstlisting}
        % Semester definition
        semester(spring).
        semester(fall).
        
        % Scheduling a course in a semester
        { schedule(Course, spring) : course(Course, Credits, Career, 1, OfferedFall) } :-
            not course_taken(Course).
        
        { schedule(Course, fall) : course(Course, Credits, Career, OfferedSpring, 1) } :-
            not course_taken(Course).
        
        % Credit calculation per semester

    \subsubsection{Design Issues \& Problems}
    \label{subsubsec:des-iss-probs}

    The query written in {\tt{results/cse\_bs\_grad\_reqs.lp}} suffered from grounding overhead, and combinatorial explosion in Clingo. These two issues in particular were likely caused by the large input of course atoms (about 207 listed undergraduate and graduate courses, in addition to their corresponding pre- and co-requisites). From the combination defined in Eq. \ref{eq:combo}, and assuming that an undergraduate student could take anywhere between 4 and 6 courses (with the basic assumption that each course averages to about 3 credits), then there would exist anywhere between $1.457 \cdot 10^6$ to $7.430 \cdot 10^7$ possible models.

    \begin{equation}
        \begin{aligned}
            C(n, k) & = \binom{n}{k} \\
            & =\frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!}
        \end{aligned}
        \label{eq:combo}
    \end{equation}

    With such a significantly large search space of 207 courses -- these large number of possible models make sense, further clarifying the extremely long runtime of {\tt{results/cse\_bs\_grad\_reqs.lp}}, for computing all possible course schedules.

    \subsection{Design Documents (updated)}
    \label{subsec:des-doc-up}

    See section \ref{subsec:design-docs} for a summary of the design document. The design document can also be found \href{\desDocLink}{here in this Google Document}. The design document at this link has been updated in accordance with the specifications of this project.

    \subsection{Project Implementation}
    \label{subsec:proj-imp}

    The project implementation can be found in the following code base, located at \href{\repoLink}{this GitHub Repository}. The development effort of the project required sizable effort -- especially in the parts pertaining to ErgoAI (which is not currently implemented). Below is a brief summary of the project:

    \begin{itemize}
        \item Languages
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Python
            \begin{itemize}
                \item Selenium
                \item Pandas
                \item webdriver-manager
            \end{itemize}
            \item Clingo
            \item ErgoAI (not implemented, but attempted)
        \end{itemize}
        \item Tools
            \begin{itemize}
                \item Conda (python environment management)
                \item Sphinx (automated documentation)
                \item Graphviz \& PyLint (for creating UML diagrams)
                \item Black (python code formatter)
            \end{itemize}
        \item Development effort: Fairly sizable, especially in reference to ErgoAI (not implemented).
        \item Code base size: moderately sized at 32,597 lines of code.
    \end{itemize}

    Lastly, this project, in its current state significantly lags behind the SOTA approaches.
    
    \section{Testing \& Evaluation}
    \label{sec:test-eval}

    % No official tests have been run yet -- as evaluation has been difficult (see section \ref{subsubsec:des-iss-probs} for further details). In the project's current state, evaluation is a tricky endeavor. Moreover, the tests that remain to be written and performed include:

    The set of tests that have been performed include: 

    \begin{itemize}
        \item Unit tests (for utility functions)
        \item Performance \& Correctness (performed via manual creation of course schedule)
    \end{itemize}
