    \section{Problem \& Plan}
    \label{sec:prob_plan}
    
    \subsection{Problem Description}
    \label{subsec:problem}
    University course planning and understanding of graduation requirements can be a difficult process for new, in-coming students at all levels of one's education. Generally, new students are guided through this process by way of an academic advisor. However, this approach is expensive in both time and personnel (which are usually university faculty) -- especially in the case in which the personnel have to be trained on where to find and understand these graduation requirements. Additionally, in some cases -- the advising can be further complicated by the student's own personal interests (e.g. research focus, specific areas of interests, etc). The proposed solution to this problem would be a knowledge graph(s) augmented generative AI for course recommendation and schedule building. A summary of the inputs and outputs are shown below:

    \subsubsection{Input \& Output}
    \label{subsubsec:in-out}
    
    \textbf{Inputs}:

    \begin{itemize}
        \label{items:inputs}
        \item Major (and minor if specified)
        \item Degree level(s): non-degree seeking, associates, bachelors, masters, doctorate
        \item Current degree progress (e.g. classes already taken)
        \item Preferred classes
        \item Preferred graduation timeline
        \item Knowledge graphs
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Graduation requirements
            \item Department policies (e.g. restrictions on pass/fail courses)
            % Policy links:
            % https://www.cs.stonybrook.edu/sites/default/files/drupalfiles/basicpage/Undergraduate%20Policies.pdf
            % https://www.cs.stonybrook.edu/sites/default/files/drupalfiles/basicpage/Professional%20Ethics.pdf
        \end{itemize}
    \end{itemize}

    \textbf{Outputs}:

    \begin{itemize}
        \label{items:outputs}
        \item Recommended schedules
        \item Course recommendations
        \item Course reviews
    \end{itemize}

    % Requirements
    \subsubsection{Requirements}
    \label{subsubsec:reqs}
    The requirements for this project would include:

    \begin{itemize}
        \item Tools
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Python
            % \item Clingo (First-Order constraint solver)
            \item ErgoAI (Knowledge graph querying)
            \item LLMs (multiple are shown, likely only one will be used)
            \begin{itemize}
                \item LLaMA\cite{touvron2023llama}/LLaMA-2\cite{touvron2023llama2}
                \item Alpaca\cite{alpaca}
                \item Chat-GPT 3.5-turbo\cite{ye2023gpt3.5}
            \end{itemize}
            \item Sub-graph extraction
            \begin{itemize}
                \item Neural State Machine for KBQA\footnote{Knowledge Base Question Answering (KBQA)}\cite{He-WSDM-2021}
            \end{itemize}
        \end{itemize}
        \item Performance evaluation
            \begin{itemize}
                \item Measure the time and accuracy of each query and compare it to Stony Brook University's schedule builder\cite{sched}
            \end{itemize}
        \item Comparison of solutions
            \begin{itemize}
                \item Compare the output of the course schedules and recommendations with Stony Brook University graduation requirements (for select majors).
            \end{itemize}
    \end{itemize}
    
    % example uses
    \subsubsection{Example use-cases}
    \label{subsubsec:example}
    Moreover, the use cases of these solutions from this project are widely applicable to Stony Brook University's undergraduate, and graduate student populations as a whole. For example, these groups of students would find significant utility from this project's solutions:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item An undergraduate computer science student looking to meet the graduation requirements for a combined BS/MS in 5 years.
        \item A MS graduate student in the computer science department looking to satisfy graduation requirements in 2 years, taking at  9--12 credits per semester.
        \item A computer science PhD student looking to satisfy course and department policy requirements.
    \end{itemize}

    Granted the above use-cases were for computer science students -- ideally, most of the Stony Brook University student population would derive some benefit from this project.

    \subsection{State of the art}
    \label{subsec:sota}
    Current state-of-the-art (SOTA) approaches for these problems at Stony Brook University include: the \href{https://you.stonybrook.edu/uaamedia/schedulebuilder/}{schedule builder} and \href{https://classie-evals.stonybrook.edu/}{classie-evals} (for course evaluations). In the case of the schedule builder -- it will mostly help students build a schedule, semester by semester\cite{sched}, but it will not recommend classes nor will it direct students to the course reviews to those classes. Additionally, using the schedule builder requires one to login into \href{https://it.stonybrook.edu/services/solar}{SOLAR}\cite{sched}. Currently, this is the best option for students creating schedules as it is widely available to Stony Brook students.
    In the case of the classie-evals, it does a good job gathering course reviews in one place\cite{class} -- however, that information could be made more available during a student's schedule building process. Furthermore, this is the best option for students deciding on whether to take a course as this information is widely available to all Stony Brook students.
    Current SOTA LLMs \cite{alpaca,touvron2023llama,touvron2023llama2,ye2023gpt3.5} have been shown to hallucinate (i.e. make very untrue statements and assert them as fact). Augmenting these LLMs as shown in \cite{luo2024} has demonstrated a viable approach to mitigating the hallucination issue that is common with LLMs. 

    \subsection{Tasks \& Sub-tasks}
    \label{subsec:tasks}
