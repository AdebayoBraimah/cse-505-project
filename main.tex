    \section{Problem \& Plan}
    \label{sec:prob_plan}
    
    \subsection{Problem Description}
    \label{subsec:problem}
    Scheduling is a highly non-trivial problem that arises in throughout many fields and industrial applications. Several examples include the job-scheduling problem\cite{scheduling1972}, and the nurse scheduling problem\cite{nurse2017}.
    University course planning/scheduling and understanding of graduation requirements can be a difficult process for new, in-coming students at all levels of one's education\cite{lunch2023}. Generally, new students are guided through this process by way of an academic advisor. However, this approach is expensive in both time and personnel (which are usually university faculty) -- especially in the case in which the personnel have to be trained on where to find and understand these graduation requirements. Additionally, in some cases -- the advising can be further complicated by the student's own personal interests (e.g. research focus, specific areas of interests, etc). The proposed solution to this problem would be knowledge graphs that are queried for course schedule building. A summary of the inputs and outputs are shown below:

    \subsubsection{Input \& Output}
    \label{subsubsec:in-out}
    
    \textbf{Inputs}:

    \begin{itemize}
        \label{items:inputs}
        \item Major
        \item Degree level: bachelors (masters and doctorate are not implemented in this project)
        \item Current degree progress (e.g. classes already taken)
        \item Knowledge graphs
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Graduation requirements
            \item Department policies (e.g. restrictions on pass/fail courses)
            % Policy links:
            % https://www.cs.stonybrook.edu/sites/default/files/drupalfiles/basicpage/Undergraduate%20Policies.pdf
            % https://www.cs.stonybrook.edu/sites/default/files/drupalfiles/basicpage/Professional%20Ethics.pdf
        \end{itemize}
    \end{itemize}

    \textbf{Outputs}:

    \begin{itemize}
        \label{items:outputs}
        \item Recommended schedule(s)
        \item Course recommendations
    \end{itemize}

    % Requirements
    \subsubsection{Requirements}
    \label{subsubsec:reqs}
    The requirements for this project would include:

    \begin{itemize}
        \item Tools
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Python
            \begin{itemize}
                \item Selenium (for web scraping, and web browser interface)
                \item BeautifulSoup4 (for web scraping) 
                \item requests (for web scraping)
                \item Pandas\cite{pandas} (for organizing data)
            \end{itemize}
            \item Clingo (ASP\footnote{Answer Set Programming} solver)\cite{clingo}
            % \item ErgoAI (Knowledge graph (KG) querying)
            % \item LLMs (large language models, multiple are shown -- likely only one will be used)
            % \begin{itemize}
            %     \item LLaMA\cite{touvron2023llama}/LLaMA-2\cite{touvron2023llama2}
            %     \item Alpaca\cite{alpaca}
            %     \item Chat-GPT 3.5-turbo\cite{ye2023gpt3.5}
            % \end{itemize}
        \end{itemize}
        \item Performance evaluation
            \begin{itemize}
                \item Measure the time and accuracy of each query and compare it to Stony Brook University's schedule builder\cite{sched}
            \end{itemize}
        \item Comparison of solutions
            \begin{itemize}
                \item Compare the output of the course schedules and recommendations with Stony Brook University graduation requirements (for computer science majors).
            \end{itemize}
    \end{itemize}
    
    % example uses
    \subsubsection{Example use-cases}
    \label{subsubsec:example}
    Moreover, the use cases of these solutions from this project is widely applicable to Stony Brook University's undergraduate student population as a whole. For example, these groups of students would find significant utility from this project's solutions:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item An undergraduate computer science student looking to meet the graduation requirements for a combined BS/MS in 5 years.
        \item A BS graduate student in the computer science department looking to satisfy graduation requirements in 4 years, taking 12--15 credits per semester.
    \end{itemize}

    Granted the above use-cases were for computer science students -- ideally, most of the Stony Brook University student population could derive some benefit from this project.

    \subsection{State of the art}
    \label{subsec:sota}
    Current state-of-the-art (SOTA) approaches for this problem at Stony Brook University includes the \href{https://you.stonybrook.edu/uaamedia/schedulebuilder/}{schedule builder} in addition to LUNCH\cite{lunch2023}. In the case of LUNCH, while it is a mostly automated approach -- it does require significant user input, and only provides the schedule for one semester. In the case of the schedule builder -- it will mostly help students build a schedule, semester by semester\cite{sched}, but it will not recommend/suggest classes.

    \subsection{Tasks \& Sub-tasks}
    \label{subsec:tasks}
    Currently, this project has no relation to any external projects (both through adjacent course work and for research purposes). Below are the corresponding tasks and sub-tasks for the project:

    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Task 1}: Knowledge graph construction (via web scraping)
        \begin{itemize}
            \item \textbf{Sub-task 1.1}: Create knowledge graphs of Stony Brook University undergraduate and graduate computer science graduation requirements (including department policies)
        \end{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Task 2}: Build API
        \begin{itemize}
            \item \textbf{Sub-task 2.1}: Create output knowledge base that can be queried.
        \end{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Task 3}: Test \& Evaluate
        \begin{itemize}
            \item \textbf{Sub-task 3.1}: Perform and automate test queries using commonly asked questions
            \item \textbf{Sub-task 3.2}: Evaluate performance (query time and accuracy)
        \end{itemize}
    \end{itemize}

    \section{Design}
    \label{sec:design}

    \subsection{API}
    \label{subsec:api}

    % TODO: Re-write this section
    
    The API implementation can be summarized as shown in the UML\footnote{Unified Modeling Language} diagram in Figure \ref{fig:uml-package} in addition to class structures for {\tt{KnowledgeBase}} and {\tt{KnowledgeGraph}} with their corresponding class attributes in Figure \ref{fig:uml-classes}. The overall system design can be described in three major components: 

    \begin{enumerate}
        \item Knowledge graph construction from SBU course catalog (described in Figure \ref{fig:kb-kg}).
        \item Converting/preprocessing JSON knowledge graph to Clingo atoms and predicates (described in Figure \ref{fig:kg-clingo}).
        \item Query the knowledge base of course requirements(described in Figure \ref{fig:kb-query}).
    \end{enumerate}


    \begin{figure}[h!]
        \centering
        \includegraphics[scale=0.65]{figures/uml/packages_src.png}
        \caption{UML Diagram of the python package}
        \label{fig:uml-package}
    \end{figure}

    The driver program of this project can be run as shown from the command line:

    {\tt{./driver.py}}

    Note, that file permissions may need to be changed for the file to run.

    \newpage 
    
    The outputs of the file are the results of the test query, printed to the command line: \\

    \begin{verbatim}

        \caption{UML Diagram of the python package's classes and corresponding attributes.}
        \label{fig:uml-classes}
    \end{figure}

    Lastly, in the {\tt{src/scripts}} directory, one can batch download other major's courses information. These set of scripts were mainly included to download and find all of the non-CSE major prerequisite courses (e.g. MAT 123, MATH 125, etc). The scripts \\ {\tt{src/scripts/download\_courses.py}} and {\tt{src/scripts/download\_courses.sh}} accomplish this purpose. The script {\tt{src/scripts/download\_courses.sh}} is a wrapper script that parallelizes {\tt{src/scripts/download\_courses.py}}. However, the wrapper script has an additional external dependency: GNU Parallel\cite{parallel2018}, which must be installed and on the system path variable for the batch download scripts to work correctly.


    \subsubsection{Implementation Details}
    \label{subsubsec:implementation}

    % TODO: Update details here
    
    The implementation details of this project are depicted in the UML diagrams shown in Figures \ref{fig:uml-package} and \ref{fig:uml-classes}. Moreover, the package {\tt{./src/schedule.py}}\footnote{NOTE: Should more help be needed, type: {\tt{./src/schedule.py -h}} for the full help menu.} is the main entry point into this program, with a command line interface (CLI) and three sub-commands: {\tt{graph}}, {\tt{convert}}, and {\tt{query}}\footnote{NOTE: Although {\tt{ErgoAI}} is available in the option menu, it is not fully supported, especially for query execution.}. These sub-commands are described in more detail below (required arguments only):

    \begin{itemize}
        \item {\tt{graph}}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item major ('CSE' for most examples)
        \end{itemize}
        \item {\tt{convert}}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item json-file (The output from the above step)
            \item {\tt{clingo}} (We want the output file to consist of clingo atoms and predicates)
        \end{itemize}
        \item {\tt{query}}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item knowledge (input knowledge base/graph to be queried) 
            \item query (input query string or file that contains rules/queries to be executed, may be specified multiple times)
        \end{itemize}
    \end{itemize}

    \subsection{Third Party Libraries}
    \label{subsec:thirdparty}

    The third party libraries currently used (mentioned in \ref{subsubsec:in-out}) include Selenium (for web scraping, and browser interface), Pandas (data organization prior to writing knowledge graphs), BeautifulSoup4 (for web scraping) and Clingo (ASP solver, installed via (mini)conda).

    \subsection{Documentation}
    \label{subsec:docs}

    The documentation of this project is contained in the {\tt{doc}} folder. Documentation was also written in reStructured Text ({\tt{.rst}}) files, and built using python via \href{https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/}{Sphinx} ({\tt{HTML}} documentation can be found in {\tt{doc/build/html/index.html}}). The {\tt{HTML}} documentation can found online \href{\docLink}{here} (recommended method of viewing this documentation).

    \subsection{Design Document}
    \label{subsec:design-docs}

    The design document\footnote{Format referenced from this AWS design document in this \href{https://github.com/aws/aws-sam-cli/blob/develop/designs/intrinsics_design.md}{GitHub repository}} for this project is located \href{\desDocLink}{here in this Google Document}. The design document can be briefly summarized as:

    \end{itemize}
    
    \section{Implementation}
    \label{sec:implement}

    \subsection{Design Implementation}
    \label{subsec:des-imp}

    The current design implementation has focused on translating knowledge graphs into facts. Correspondingly, knowledge bases were translated into rules. For example, the the class information shown in the JSON snippet below,  could be translated into the following fact\footnote{NOTE: JSON fields "spring" and "fall" entail if the course is offered in the spring and/or in the fall (i.e. 1 implies offered, 0 implies not offered).}:

    \begin{lstlisting}
{
    .
    .
    .
    "CSE214":{
    "CourseTitle":"Data Structures",
    "Career":"Undergraduate",
    "Credits":4.0,
    "Prerequisites":[
        [
            "CSE114"
        ]
    ],
    "Antirequisites":"NONE",
    "Corequisites":"NONE",
    "Description":"An extension of programming methodology to data storage and manipulation on complex data sets. Topics include: programming and applications of data structures; stacks, queues, lists, binary trees, heaps, priority queues, balanced trees and graphs. Recursive programming is heavily utilized. Fundamental sorting and searching algorithms are examined along with informal efficiency comparisons.",
    "spring":1.0,
    "fall":1.0
    },
    "CSE215":{
        "CourseTitle":"Foundations of Computer Science",
        "Career":"Undergraduate",
        "Credits":4.0,
        "Prerequisites":[
            [
                "AMS151",
                "MAT125",
                "MAT131"
            ]
        ],
        "Antirequisites":"NONE",
        "Corequisites":"NONE",
        "Description":"Introduction to the logical and mathematical foundations of computer science. Topics include functions, relations, and sets; recursion; elementary logic; and mathematical induction and other proof techniques.",
        "spring":1.0,
        "fall":1.0
    },
.
.
.
}
    \end{lstlisting}

    Facts translation in Clingo (located in: {\tt{src/resources/cse\_courses.lp}})): \\
    
    \begin{lstlisting}
% Clingo code
% Define course(course_name, credits, career, offered_spring, offered_fall)
course(cse214, 4, "Undergraduate", 1, 1).
course(cse215, 4, "Undergraduate", 1, 1).
.
.
.
% Define prerequisites
.
.
.
% Prerequisites for CSE214
:- course(cse214, 4, "Undergraduate", 1, 1), 
   not course(cse114, _, "Undergraduate", _, _). 

% Prerequisites for CSE215
:- course(cse215, 4, "Undergraduate", 1, 1), 
   not course(ams151, _, "Undergraduate", _, _), 
   not course(mat125, _, "Undergraduate", _, _), 
   not course(mat131, _, "Undergraduate", _, _). 
    \end{lstlisting}

    Correspondingly, the knowledge base facts were translated into rules. For example, the fact a student needs take a minimum of 12 credits a semester (to maintain full time student status, shown on line 3 in the listing below as a constant), but a maximum of 18 credits (shown on line 4 as constant in the listing below) over $N$ semesters to graduate with CSE major 80 credits and 120 total credits would be translated as the following in Clingo (in the file, {\tt{results/cse\_bs\_grad\_reqs.lp}}): \\

    \begin{lstlisting}
% Constants
#const max_semesters = 12.
#const min_credits_per_semester = 12.
#const max_credits_per_semester = 18.

% Define possible semesters
semester(1..max_semesters).

% Schedule courses across semesters
1 { schedule(Course, Sem) : semester(Sem) } 1 :- course(Course, Credits, Career, Spring, Fall).

% Prevent scheduling of courses already taken
:- course_taken(Course), schedule(Course, _).

% Semester limits: at least 12 credits and at most 18 credits per semester
:- semester(Sem), SemCredits = #count { Credits, Course : schedule(Course, Sem), course(Course, Credits, "Undergraduate", _, _) }, SemCredits < min_credits_per_semester.
:- semester(Sem), SemCredits = #count { Credits, Course : schedule(Course, Sem), course(Course, Credits, "Undergraduate", _, _) }, SemCredits > max_credits_per_semester.

% Ensure all scheduled courses comply with seasonal offerings
:- schedule(Course, Sem), course(Course, _, "Undergraduate", Spring, Fall), 
   Sem \ 2 = 1, Fall = 0.
:- schedule(Course, Sem), course(Course, _, "Undergraduate", Spring, Fall), 
   Sem \ 2 = 0, Spring = 0.

% Count total credits and major credits
total_credits(Total) :- Total = #sum { Credits, Course : schedule(Course, _), course(Course, Credits, "Undergraduate", _, _) }.
major_credits(Major) :- Major = #sum { Credits, Course : schedule(Course, _), course(Course, Credits, "Undergraduate", _, _) }.

% Graduation requirements
:- total_credits(Total), Total < 120.
:- major_credits(Major), Major < 80.

% Objective to minimize the number of semesters
#minimize { 1, Sem : schedule(_, Sem) }.

#show schedule/2.
    \end{lstlisting}

    Moreover, the above code suffers from combinatorial explosion (i.e. the number of combinations that satisfies the model are so large, that the optimal model would take a significant amount of time to be computed).
    Instead, computing the schedule of two semesters is far more feasible. The code to do so is located in the file {\tt{results/sem.lp}}): \\

    \begin{lstlisting}
% Semester definition
semester(spring).
semester(fall).

% Scheduling a course in a semester

    \subsubsection{Design Issues \& Problems}
    \label{subsubsec:des-iss-probs}

    The query written in {\tt{results/cse\_bs\_grad\_reqs.lp}} suffered from grounding overhead, and combinatorial explosion in Clingo. These two issues in particular were likely caused by the large input of course atoms (about 207 listed undergraduate and graduate courses, in addition to their corresponding pre- and co-requisites). From the combination defined in Eq. \ref{eq:combo}, and assuming that an undergraduate student could take anywhere between 4 and 6 courses (with the basic assumption that each course averages to about 3 credits), then there would exist anywhere between $1.457 \cdot 10^6$ to $7.430 \cdot 10^7$ possible combinations.

    \begin{equation}
        \begin{aligned}
            C(n, k) & = \binom{n}{k} \\
            & =\frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!}
        \end{aligned}
        \label{eq:combo}
    \end{equation}

    With such a significantly large search space of 207 courses -- these large number of possible combinations make sense, further clarifying the extremely long runtime of {\tt{results/cse\_bs\_grad\_reqs.lp}}, for computing all possible course schedules.

    \subsection{Design Documents (updated)}
    \label{subsec:des-doc-up}

    See section \ref{subsec:design-docs} for a summary of the design document. The design document can also be found \href{\desDocLink}{here in this Google Document}. The design document at this link has been updated in accordance with the specifications of this project.

    \subsection{Project Implementation}
    \label{subsec:proj-imp}

    The project implementation can be found in the following code base, located at \href{\repoLink}{this GitHub Repository}. The development effort of the project required sizable effort -- especially in the parts pertaining to ErgoAI (which is not currently implemented). Below is a brief summary of the project:

    \begin{itemize}
        \item Languages
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Python
            \begin{itemize}
                \item Selenium
                \item Pandas
                \item BeautifulSoup4
                \item Requests
            \end{itemize}
            \item Clingo
            \item ErgoAI (not implemented, but attempted)
        \end{itemize}
        \item Tools
            \begin{itemize}
                \item Conda (python environment management)
                \item Sphinx (automated documentation)
                \item Graphviz \& PyLint (for creating UML diagrams)
                \item Black (python code formatter)
            \end{itemize}
        \item Development effort: Fairly sizable, especially in reference to ErgoAI (not implemented).
        \item Code base size: moderately sized at 32,597 lines of code.
    \end{itemize}

    Lastly, this project, in its current state significantly lags behind the SOTA approaches -- mainly in terms of reliability (correctness) rather than speed.
    
    \section{Testing \& Evaluation}
    \label{sec:test-eval}

    The set of tests that have been performed include: 

    \begin{itemize}
        \item Unit tests (for utility functions)
        \item Performance \& Correctness (performed via manual creation of course schedule)
    \end{itemize}

    The unit tests mainly covered the utility functions and were implemented using PyTest. The unit tests are located in the {\tt{src/tests}} directory, can be run by typing: {\tt{cd src/tests}}, and running {\tt{pytest}} (assuming pytest is already installed). Manual testing was performed to evaluate the full scheduler and the two semester scheduler performance and correctness. The manual method (hand making schedules) was often correct -- but more time consuming (in both cases). The automated method for the 2 semester approach is fast -- but the correctness is questionable, as the courses are not sensibly scheduled. Additionally, the automated approach for 12 semester scheduling took so long, that the program was terminated prior to finding any models (see sec. \ref{subsubsec:des-iss-probs} for explanations as why this was the case). Results of the manual testing performance (in seconds) are shown in Figures \ref{fig:2sem} and \ref{fig:12sem}. Additionally, the commands to perform the (automated) evaluation are as follows: \\

    \begin{lstlisting}
# 2 sem
./src/schedule.py query --knowledge=results/cse_courses.lp --query=results/sem.lp --query=results/cse_prereqs.lp --clingo

# 12 sem approach # NOTE: This will not stop running
./src/schedule.py query --knowledge=results/cse_courses.lp --query=results/cse_bs_grad_reqs.lp --query=results/cse_prereqs.lp --clingo

# eval - 2 sem
./src/schedule.py query --knowledge=results/eval/cse_courses.eval.lp --query=results/sem.lp --query=results/cse_prereqs.lp --clingo

# eval - 12 sem # NOTE: This will not stop running
./src/schedule.py query --knowledge=results/eval/cse_bs_grad_reqs.eval.lp --query=results/eval/cse_courses.eval.lp --query=results/cse_prereqs.lp --clingo
    \end{lstlisting}

    \section{Challenges \& Summary}
    \label{sec:chall-summ}

    The main challenges experienced in this project was that SBU's course catalog is not easily accessible for analysis. This was evident by the absence of available API access. Additionally, the course catalog was written in JavaScript -- making web scraping a difficult endeavor. Furthermore, satisfying the constraint in clingo for as originally planned was highly improbable (as explained in sec. \ref{subsubsec:des-iss-probs}) -- which can mainly be attributed to grounding overhead and combinatorial explosion. The original approach is more appropriate for checking if degree requirements have been satisfied. Lastly, modifying the core idea to accommodate two semesters rather than an arbitrary number of semesters has shown why the scheduling problem in this context is extremely challenging.
