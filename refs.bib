	abstract = {The Nurse Scheduling problem (NSP) is a combinatorial problem that consists of assigning nurses to shifts according to given practical constraints. In previous years, several approaches have been proposed to solve different variants of the NSP. In this paper, an ASP encoding for one of these variants is presented, whose requirements have been provided by an Italian hospital. We also design a second encoding for the computation of “optimal” schedules. Finally, an experimental analysis has been conducted on real data provided by the Italian hospital using both encodings. Results are very positive: the state-of-the-art ASP system CLINGO is able to compute one year schedules in few minutes, and it scales well even when more than one hundred nurses are considered.},

@misc{lunch2023,

	abstract = {Timetable scheduling is a known NP-hard problem; despite this, there
have been many efforts to enable fast and efficient algorithms and heuristics for
such a challenging task. Within the realm of timetable scheduling lies the particularly complex problem of Course Scheduling (CS). The goal in CS is to find
an optimal timetable configuration of courses within the constraints set by faculty, course requirements and departmental functions. Answer Set Programming
(ASP) is a declarative logic programming paradigm for solving combinatorial
search tasks; instead of explicitly writing the solution to the problem, ASP programs define the problem’s constraints and knowledge in a high-level language,
leaving the model search to a highly optimized solver. In this work, we construct and showcase LUNCH, an easily extensible, free and open-source system
for course scheduling. Notably, we study the use of ASP for course scheduling
within the specific context of the Computer Science Department at the University
of Sao Paulo, showing how LUNCH fares against the manual scheduling done in
previous years},
